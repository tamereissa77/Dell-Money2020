# Nemotron Voice Agent Client

The Nemotron Voice Agent Client is the browser front end for the [Nemotron Voice Agent](../README.md) blueprint. It gives you a real-time, interruptible voice conversation with the agent, along with controls to switch models and prompts, preview TTS voices, watch live latency metrics, and follow the conversation transcript.

It is a React and TypeScript single-page app built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and the [Pipecat Client SDK](https://docs.pipecat.ai/client/introduction). The client connects to the Python backend (`src/server.py`) over WebRTC or WebSocket and reads its `/api/*` endpoints for session, service, and voice configuration. In a deployed stack the backend serves this client's production build from `client/dist/`, so you normally reach the UI at `https://localhost:7860` rather than running it on its own.

## Features

- **Cascaded pipeline view**: follow the ASR → LLM → TTS flow live.
- **Dual transport**: WebRTC (recommended) or WebSocket.
- **Runtime service switching**: add or remove LLM, ASR, and TTS services without redeploying.
- **Prompt management**: pick a built-in persona or write a custom system prompt.
- **Voice selection**: browse and preview TTS voices with language filtering.
- **Audio visualizers**: real-time input and output waveform display.
- **Metrics dashboard**: time-to-first-byte latency charts, token usage, and connection status.
- **Conversation transcript**: live ASR and bot-response display.
- **Webcam vision panel**: live webcam input for the multimodal Omni Subagents example.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer and npm.
- A running Nemotron Voice Agent backend. See the repo [Getting Started](../docs/01-getting-started.md) guide.

### Run in development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server starts at `http://localhost:5173` with hot-module reload, which is convenient for fast UI iteration. The full experience also needs the backend running for the `/api/*` endpoints and the WebRTC/WebSocket session, so the simplest way to exercise the complete UI is the backend-served build below.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build is type-checked with `tsc` and emitted to `dist/`. The Python server serves it automatically from `client/dist/`, so after building you reach the UI at `https://localhost:7860`. Rebuild whenever you change the client and redeploy.

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

ESLint runs the TypeScript, React Hooks, and React Refresh rules defined in `eslint.config.js`.

## Backend endpoints

The client reads its configuration from the backend (`src/server.py`) and starts sessions through these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/deployment` | Active example, available services, and UI capabilities |
| `/api/session-config` | Prompts and default session settings |
| `/api/tts-config` | Available TTS voices and languages |
| `/api/ice-servers` | STUN/TURN configuration for WebRTC |
| `/api/webcam-config` | Webcam capture defaults for multimodal examples |
| `/api/start` | Start a pipeline session |
