# Configure Services

The Nemotron Voice Agent uses example-local service catalogs to manage LLM, ASR, TTS, and example-specific services. Built-in entries come from each example's `services.cloud.yaml` (remote / NVCF) and `services.local.yaml` (Compose-managed sidecars). The active UI example determines which catalog is loaded.

This guide covers the **mechanics**: how catalogs are loaded, switched, and extended.

## How catalog selection works

- Each example owns its catalog at `<example-package>/services.cloud.yaml` (remote / NVCF) and optional `<example-package>/services.local.yaml` (Compose-managed sidecars).
- The cloud catalog is always loaded.
- The local catalog is merged on top, but only entries whose endpoint is reachable on TCP are exposed in the UI and used by the pipeline.
- `services.local.yaml` is split into per-platform sections (`workstation`, `dgxspark`, `jetson`), and the `PLATFORM` env var selects which one is merged. Docker Compose recipe profiles set `PLATFORM` automatically, so the matching local services load with no extra steps. For host-native on-prem runs, set it in `.env` to `cloud`, `workstation`, `dgxspark`, or `jetsonthor`.
- The same `--profile` works whether you run cloud-only or with local sidecars. Nothing else needs to be set.

## Switching services in the UI

The Services tab lists all services exposed by the active catalog (cloud and reachable local entries). Click an entry to make it the active selection for that category. Selections persist in browser localStorage. Custom services added through the UI also live in localStorage.

## Changing built-in defaults

Each example declares its default service per slot via `defaults` in `examples_registry.yaml`. The pipeline resolves that default at startup, and the UI uses it as the initial selection. Edit `defaults` (and optionally reorder entries in the `services.cloud.yaml` / `services.local.yaml` for visual ordering in the UI) to change defaults.

When the same default key exists in both `services.cloud.yaml` and `services.local.yaml`, the resolver prefers the **self-hosted** variant so that deploying local NIM sidecars automatically promotes them to the active default. No UI click is needed. If the self-hosted endpoint is unreachable at session-start time, the runtime falls back to the cloud variant.

> **On-prem note:** self-hosted promotion only applies when the `defaults` key also exists in `services.local.yaml`. A default whose key exists **only** in `services.cloud.yaml` resolves to the cloud model even on an on-prem recipe. Point `defaults` at a local key or pick the model from the Services tab.

## On-prem catalog

`services.local.yaml` groups entries under platform sections (`workstation`, `dgxspark`, `jetson`).

To configure a specific local model, check its Docker Compose file under [`docker/`](../../docker/) for the **service name**, **port**, and the **profile** that launches it, then point a catalog entry at that endpoint. For example, Nemotron ASR Streaming (English) is defined in [`docker/docker-compose.nemotron-asr.yaml`](../../docker/docker-compose.nemotron-asr.yaml):

```yaml
services:
  nemotron-asr-streaming-english:
    image: nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/nemotron-asr-streaming:1.3.0
    profiles:
      - generic-assistant/workstation
      - frontend-backend-agent/workstation
    ports:
      - "50152:50052"   # host:container (gRPC)
    environment:
      NIM_TAGS_SELECTOR: type=en-US,mode=str
```

The matching `asr` entry in the example's `services.local.yaml` points at that Compose service name and **container** port (`50052`):

```yaml
workstation:
  asr:
    nemotron-asr-streaming-english:
      name: "Nemotron ASR Streaming English"
      server: "nemotron-asr-streaming-english:50052"
      model: "cache-aware-parakeet-rnnt-multi-asr-streaming-sortformer"
      function_id: ""
```

Use the Compose service name and container port in `server`. For host-native runs (outside Docker), the backend rewrites it to the published host port automatically. Here `nemotron-asr-streaming-english:50052` becomes `localhost:50152`.

Each ASR, LLM, and TTS model sidecar is defined in a `docker/docker-compose.*.yaml` file and gated by Compose `profiles`. Check those files for the service that serves a given model. To run models locally for a **new example**, add your example's profile (e.g. `my-example/workstation`) to the relevant service(s) there, and add the matching entries to that example's `services.local.yaml` (as shown above). The catalog then picks up the sidecars automatically once they are reachable. See [Deployment Profiles](../01-getting-started.md#docker-based-deployment) for the profile list.

## Adding built-in cloud services

Append entries to the relevant `services.cloud.yaml`. Refresh the browser for host-run development, or rebuild/redeploy Docker to package the change into the image.

```yaml
llm:
  my-custom-llm:
    name: "My Custom LLM"
    model_id: "org/model-name"
    base_url: "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"
    supported_languages: [en, de]
    system_prompt: ""
    extra_params: ""
```

`supported_languages` is optional LLM capability metadata for the multilingual assistant. When present, the UI offers only session locales whose base language appears in the list. Omit it for a custom LLM when its language capabilities are unknown; this preserves unrestricted, backward-compatible behavior. An explicitly empty list permits no session locales.

```yaml
asr:
  my-custom-asr:
    name: "My Custom ASR"
    server: "grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443"
    model: "my-asr-model"
    function_id: ""
```

```yaml
tts:
  my-custom-tts:
    name: "My Custom TTS"
    server: "grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443"
    voice_id: "Magpie-Multilingual.EN-US.Aria"
    model: "magpie-tts-multilingual"
    function_id: "<NVCF_FUNCTION_ID>"
    synthesis_mode: stitched
```
