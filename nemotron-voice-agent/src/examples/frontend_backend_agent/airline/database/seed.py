"""Seed data for a fresh booking database.

The fixture rows themselves live in JSONL files under ``seed_data/``
(``flights.jsonl`` for the alternatives catalog, ``pnrs.jsonl`` for the
PNR fixtures); this module only owns the load + insert logic.
Idempotent only in the sense that ``db.init_db`` calls this at most
once per database lifecycle (gated on empty ``pnrs``); the individual
INSERTs themselves rely on UNIQUE constraints and will raise on repeat.
